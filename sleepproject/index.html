            <h2>1. Consider your alcohol consumption</h2>
            More than a couple of drinks at night decreases your overall sleep quality. Besides the fact more bathroom visits are inevitable, it slows some of the brain's functions to produce hormones and messes with your inner alarm clock. 
Consuming a heavy meal before bed also isn't advised. Having all that food for the body to focus on digesting instead of using that energy to recharge your batteries and replenish the body's functions. 
Once in a while won't tip the scales, but extended periods of over consumption will also result in an aggravation of your body's nightly rhythm.

            <h2>2. Optimize your bedroom</h2>
            <p>Your bedroom is vital for optimization of a good night’s sleep. 
                This includes everything from external light sources and the temperature, even the arrangement of the furniture in your rooms has proven to impact your sleep schedule. 
                Also, daily ventilation of the bedroom (if possible) and regularly switching the bedsheets improves the overall quality of the sleep. 
                For most people, the optimal temperature when sleeping lies around 20*C.

            <h2>3. Relax in the evening before bedtime</h2>
            <p>An hour leading up to your bedtime, spend the time however way makes you relax. 
                Listen to music, read a book, draw, knit, meditate. Getting a routine up and going will allow your body to recognize bedtime easier, boosting the effects. Avoid looking too much into the generic lights from screens, as it disrupts the circadian rhythm you are creating for yourself. 
                A small workout or walk are also viable options, as long as you are getting to a relaxed state of mind.

            <h2>4. Exercise regularly - But not right before bed</h2>
            <p>Even though a small workout session or walk benefits sleep,
                 building up too much of a sweat can have the opposite effect on your body. 
                 There is no doubt, exercising regularly improves your health and benefits your sleeping schedule. 
                 Many of the consequences following sleep deprivation, such as sleep apnea and insomnia, have reduced 
                 impact on people with a workout routine. Especially outdoor exercising in the sun is a recipe for success, 
                 and even if workout before bedtime is not recommended, getting a workout is still beneficial.

            <h2>5. Get a rhythm for yourself, your brain will appreciate it!</h2>
            <p>Your body has a built-in clock that tries to align itself with the sunrise and sunset. This is called a circadian rhythm, and having a stable one can aid long term sleep quality. 
                The more consistently you go to bed and wake up at the same time, pattern forms inside your brain, helping recognize sleep is near and setting the internal alarm for the next day. Studies also highlight an irregular sleep pattern and going late to bed alters the body levels of melatonin, a hormone created in your brain responsible for your circadian rhythm.
                After several weeks of repetition, you might not even need the use of an alarm clock!
